# Project_1_Treasure_Trove
Project 1 Team Build Treasure Trove 

This is a CWRU coding bootcamp Project 1 Assignment.  This project is to show that the students are able to work in a team setting, come up with an original idea and
collaborate together to develop a project.  This project demonstrates the students ability to become comfortable working in a group setting and learning the functionality of GitHub. This project uses the project board function using Kanban and the agile software development method of GitHub which allows for the students to create and delegate tasks.  The group members needed to communicate effectively and work together to build a functioning application.

## User Story

This app was designed for treasure hunters to save locations of where they discovered their treasures.  The app also displays potential treasures that treasure
hunters can find with the treasure chest section.  


## Acceptance Criteria

The application utilizes a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
The application is deployed to GitHub.
There was interaction throughout the project and fantastic communication throughout the group.
2 server-side APIs are used in the application (Unsplash and BING Maps)
No alerts, confirms, or promts are used.
App is responsive and easy to use.
We worked together to make sure we made many GitHub commits and were sure to review work in order to eliminate any merge issues.
