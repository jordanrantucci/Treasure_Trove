# Project_1_Treasure_Trove
Project 1 Team Build Treasure Trove 

This is a CWRU coding bootcamp Project 1 Assignment.  This project is to show that the students are able to work in a team setting, come up with an original idea and
collaborate together to develop a project.

## User Story

```
This app would be usefull for someone that was potentially traveling to a city and wanted to get the upcoming weather forecast.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

I was not able to complete this portion of the homework by making the cities clickable
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
I was able to reopen the dashboard and see the previous searched city, however the content needs to be cleared upon inspection.
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```
